This project was originally made for a homeschooling Co-Op that my sisters went to. It was supposed to be a simple, easy way for them to communicate with each other and plan for the Co-Op.
It has simple features like Group chats, private one-on-one chats, sending files, sending emojis, gifs and more. The backend is handled by Stream (https://getstream.io), and the frontend is a static page
in ReactJS. To use the project, just open the server folder and run: npm i. Do the same in client. Make sure that you put you Stream API key and Secret in the correct places.
And also put them in the .env file. Then open a terminal and run npm start for both the server and client. Enjoy!
